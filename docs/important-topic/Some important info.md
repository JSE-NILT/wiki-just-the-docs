# Here the could be a lot of info
This could be a lot of text...

## Some topic

This is the first topic of many, so lets make some bullet points

Or bullet points:
- Bullet
- Point
  - Point Point

Bullets points can be booring some times, so maybe things should be in a table instead.

### Tables 

I could be a table over good and *evil* animals

| **Good** | **Evil** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Big dogs | Cats |
| Chickens | Small dogs |  


## Math

Maybe it even supports some fancy math stuff?

$$
\begin{aligned}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Does it work..? 
## Important image

An image is worth a thousand words, right..?

[Big dog, small picture...](../../assets/images/dog.JPG)

That is for sure *fancy*!
